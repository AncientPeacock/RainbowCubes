## General info
 In this project, I was inspired by the “Cube Surfer!” game and added new mechanics in line with the feedback I received, adding a different atmosphere to the game.  

 When the game starts, all you have to do is swipe the player left and right to collect the colored cubes. But remember, the difference between the cubes you stack under your feet should not exceed three, or you will lose! 

 Each cube you collect will spawn a random emoji in the upper left corner. You must reach the rainbow stairs to successfully complete the game. 

 Good luck and have fun mate!
